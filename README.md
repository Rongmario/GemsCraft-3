This is a Mod originally by Domi1819
Me and a few others are attempting to bring it back, even better.
GemsCraft 3 everyone, you can also compile the code right now, hopefully it should work.

Compiling with srg-names will work on 1.6.4 (Have tried personally, try it) ;)
Go to Pahimar's Equivalent Exchange 3 Repo to see the steps of compiling the code, thanks Pahimar ;)
